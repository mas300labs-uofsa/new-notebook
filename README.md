Starting from 

First, modify environment to add any libraries you need.  Currently, it only has:

- wget
- pip

Update the Binder button below:
- change 'new-notebook' with whatever you called the repo for your new notebook.
- if you are not in mas300labs-uofsa, then change that part of the url as well
- remove the `code quotes` around the button. 
```
Click on the Binder button to open the Notebook:

```

Then modify the Notebook.
